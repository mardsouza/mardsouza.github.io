# Outreach

!!! abstract ":construction:"
    This section is still under development, but I'll put here a quick overview of some projects I've been working on!


## Masterclass

MasterClass is an international event that brings about 10.000 high school students in 40 countries to come to one of 200 nearby universities or research centers around the world with the goal of showing them (and their teachers) that Physics is a fascinating subject and that through its study we can learn more about some of the greatest mysteries of the universe – what are the fundamental and elementary particles that form it? How do they interact with each other?

At the São Paulo Research and Analysis Center (SPRACE), the International MasterClass event has been organized since 2008, always with increasing number of schools and participants. In 2018, over 400 students took part in three MasterClass events held in our premises.
